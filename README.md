# Code Style

A guide to my Java/PHP/Obj-C style and conventions.

This is an attempt to encourage patterns that accomplish the following goals (in
rough priority order):

 1. Increased rigor, and decreased likelihood of programmer error
 2. Increased readability
 3. Increased clarity of intent
 4. Reduced verbosity

## Coding conventions

### Indent style

 * Use IDE default configuration, instead of your preferences, to be able to setup the source code in any other environment.
 * If there are multiple IDEs (developing for PHP, using Eclipse, Netbeans, PHPStorm...), use tabs, not spaces. Configure tab size as you wish, so other developers could choose their own tab size without modifying source code.
 * When writing XML files (like Android layouts), use the auto-indent tool to sort attributes and indent nodes.

### Whitespace

 * End files with a newline.
 * Make liberal use of vertical whitespace to divide code into logical chunks.
 * Donâ€™t leave trailing whitespace.

### Variable names

 * Choose a good name, one that accurately describes the use of the variable.
 * The bigger the variable scope is, the larger the name should be.
 * Use language conventions. If not, choose camelCase naming convention.
 * When naming UI widgets, like TextView, UILabel..., use first two letters (if possible) to design the type, and choose the use of the widget. For example: tvUserName or lbPlaceAddress.

### Constants

 * Use language conventions: Upper case in Java, k prefix in Obj-C...
 * (Java, PHP...) Underscore naming convention.
 * Name should be composed by every context it belongs to, from bigger to smaller. Ex:
```java
public static final PREFERENCES_USER_NAME = "PREFERENCES_USER_NAME";
```

### Methods

 * Choose where do you like to put open bracket (same line method definition or next line). Use the same standart to every method!
 * If you like open bracket same line, keep a white space between parameters and bracket.

### Method parameters

 * Parameters should be ordered by importance or usage.
 * In PHP or similar languages, optional parameters should be the last ones.
 * In Android, if you need to send Context, set it as the first one. Callbacks should be at the end.

### Spaces

 * Use spaces like natural writing: respect spaces between words and operators. Ex:
```php
// Use this
$oneAwesomeArray = array('foo' => 'bar');
$var = $arg1 . 'static string' . $arg2;
// Instead of this
$oneAwesomeArray=array('foo'=>'bar');
$var=$arg1.'static string'.$arg2;
```
 * Use them also between method parameters. Ex:
```php
// Use this
public function analyzeAnArray($theArray, $someFlag, $anotherFlag = true) {
    // The code
}
// Instead of this
public function analyzeAnArray($theArray,$someFlag,$anotherFlag=true){
    // The code
}
```

### Comments

 * Use first capital letter when starting a comment.
 * Keep one whitespace between line comment syntax and the first word. Ex:
```java
// The explanation
```
 * Use them to describe the reason why you write the code, not what you are doing (any programmer could understand what are you doing but not why you did or choose that solution).
 * Write comments over the block of code you want to explain, not in the same line.
For example, use this:
```java
// If user is allowed to edit resources and the resource is not blocked
if (user.couldEditResources() && !resource.isBlocked()) {
    // The code
}
```
Instead of this.
```java
if (user.couldEditResources() && !resource.isBlocked()) { // If user is allowed to edit resources and the resource is not blocked
    // The code
}
```
 * Remember adding javadoc for complex or critical methods. I recommend writing final dots as natural language. Keep one line separation between method explanation and parameter descriptions. Use html format to highlight important quotes. Add website and local links if needed. Ex:
```java
/**
 * The method explanation. <strong>Important note</strong>. Referenced here:
 * http://www.alink.com
 *
 * @param int param1 The param1 description.
 * @param int param2 The param2 description.
 * @return int The result description.
 */
public int myCriticalMethod(int param1, int param2) {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

### Return and break early

When you have to meet certain criteria to continue execution, try to exit early. So, instead of this:

```java
if (!myArray.isEmpty()) {
    // Code
} else {
    return
}
```

use this:
```java
if (myArray.isEmpty()) {
    return
}
// Code
```

It is very important when writing a method with several validation block of codes. Real code execution and result should be at the end of the method. Ex:

```java
public int calculateAValue(Integer arg1, Integer arg2) {
    // First validation
    if (arg1 == null || arg2 == null) {
        // Stop execution here
        throw new Exception("The error message");
    }
    
    // Continue next validation
    if (arg1 < 1) {
        // Stop execution here
        throw new Exception("The error message");
    }
    
    // Real code
    return arg1 + arg2;
}
```

Use only one return inside a method, even using switchs and ifs, when you are not validating input. Ex:

```java
public int calculateSomething(int arg1, int arg2) {
    // Initialize return variable with default value
    int result = 0;
    // Perform operations
    switch (arg1) {
        case ARGS_KEY1:
            // Calculate the value, but don't return the value
            result = arg2 * ARGS_VALUE1;
        break;
        case ARGS_KEY2:
            // Calculate the value, but don't return the value
            result = arg2 - ARGS_VALUE2;
        break;
    }
    // Only one return, at the final of the method
    return result;
}
```

## Class variables and method order

 1. Public constants should be at the beginning of the class
 2. Protected constants
 3. Private constants
 4. Public attributes
 5. Protected attributes
 6. Private attributes
 7. Static instance constructors
 8. Constructors
 9. Overriden methods (including lifecycle methods, interface or protocol implementations...)
 10. Public methods
 11. Protected methods
 12. Private methods

### Paths and directories

When you have to define the path of a directory, it should finish with a file separator. Example:

```php
$filesDirectoryPath = '/var/app/files/';
```

This way, when you have to contact a directory path with a file name, you don't have to add a file separator.
When you are working with directory paths, you know all of them finish with the separator.

When naming path variables, you should specify if they refer to a aboslute path or the name of the folder:

```php
$filesDirectoryPath = '/var/app/files/';
$filePath = '/var/app/files/theFile.ext';
```

## Databases

### General

Use underscores to separate words.

Keep a logic column order, starting with ids and finishing with timestamps.

Every column should be non null by default unless necessary.

### Encoding

Use UTF-8 encoding for every text and varchar columns. Set it when creating a new database and ensure it is configured when adding new tables.

### File sizes

You should save file sizes in bytes, to avoid losing accuracy.

### Dates

Dates should be saved in UTC. If you need to save a specific date in local time, save also timezone in another column.

### Foreign keys

Foreign keys should be named starting at "id_", so if a table has an id and a foreign key, they could be named as following:

- id
- id_foreign_table

### Indexes

If you usually select data from a table looking for a specific foreign key (for example), create an index to optimize queries.

Don't overload your database with indexes.

## Git

### Issue management

- Create milestones when you want to release a new software version.
- Create one or more issues per feature
- Use labels to describe issue
- Use labels to follow progress
- Create issues when a bug is discovered, and use labels to describe its progress

## Projects with different technologies

When developing a project that involves different programming languages, like PHP + Python, or multiple related projects that share some configuration, create a simple text file (in json format, for example).
